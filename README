This is just a simple attempt to implement Conway's Game of Life in Python.

The tables are stored using numpy and for the graphics pygame is needed.

To run the program use:

$python cgol.py cells_x cells_y density

where cells_x and cells_y are the number of cells in the x and y axis respectively and density is the initial probability of a cell being alive.

Some tips on the usage of pygame were found in http://www.daniweb.com/software-development/python/code/217028/the-game-of-life 

This is the first working version, hopefully more work will be done, mainly dealing with performance issues and allowing larger worlds.
