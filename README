This is just a simple attempt to implement Conway's Game of Life in Python.

For the graphics pygame is needed.

To run the program use:

$python cgol.py cells_x cells_y density

where cells_x and cells_y are the number of cells in the x and y axis respectively and density is the initial probability of a cell being alive.

Currently in the process of implementing the various optimizations proposed in Michael Abrash's Graphics Programming Black Book.

Some tips on the usage of pygame were found in http://www.daniweb.com/software-development/python/code/217028/the-game-of-life 

** LOG **
** Version 2.00: Updated code so bits are used for cell representation.
** Version 1.10: Updated code so that cells are redrawn only if needed.
** Version 1.00: First working version, using numpy.
